                <p>Design Decolonization takes into account the ties between historical desgin trends and Eurocentric/Anglocentric perspectives. Through this perspective, there is little consideration for marginalized groups and that is reflected in these practices. This is especially harmful, as it can lead to unsustainable design theory and can isolate groups that can otherwise benefit from culture-specific design. </br>
                Specifically, lets look at a country with years of colonialism in its history: India. </br>
                Understanding the effects of colonialism is the first step to becoming aware of the effects of eurocentric design practices on non-european countries.</p>

                <p>Kalighat paintings, a traditional art form, emerged in the 19th century in the vicinity of Kolkata, West Bengal. Rooted in the local culture of West Bengal, Kalighat paintings hold profound cultural significance for the ethnic groups in the region. Initially centered around depictions of gods and goddesses, Kalighat paintings evolved over time to become a vehicle for social commentary and criticism of the prevailing class system. The transformation of these artworks reflects a dynamic shift from religious themes to an exploration of societal issues. Kalighat paintings, with their origins in Kolkata, not only serve as artistic expressions but also offer valuable insights into the cultural and social dynamics of the region.</p>

                <p>Mandana paintings represent a distinctive form of tribal art from the Sahariya region in Madhya Pradesh. Executed during significant events or celebrations like weddings, these paintings serve as both aesthetic expressions and cultural markers. Typically applied to walls or floors of homes, Mandana paintings hold a special place in the Sahariya community's artistic practices. Each component of a Mandana painting contributes to a common motif, imbuing the entire artwork with layers of cultural significance. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, this art form represents visual narratives into the Sahariya tribe's cultural identity.</p>

                <p>Pichwai paintings trace their origins back over 400 years to the vibrant state of Rajasthan. The term 'Pichwai' is derived from 'pichh,' meaning back, and 'wai,' referring to a textile hanging. These intricately crafted textiles hold religious significance, primarily portraying the stories of Krishna. Characterized by their cultural richness, Pichwai have become emblematic of Rajasthan's artistic heritage. Beyond their ornamental role, Pichwai paintings serve as visual narrators, capturing the essence of Krishna's tales and contributing to the cultural tapestry of the region. Initially crafted to embellish temple spaces, these paintings gradually transcended their original purpose, finding a place in homes and various cultural settings. </p>

                        <p>Continuity and patterns play a huge role in many traditional indian designs. An example of this can be found in Jali's, or pierced screens. Jali's consist of geometric patterns usually of a hexagonal and octagonal pattern. In addition, they can also be adorned with flowers, trees, or a paisley decoration, for more complexity. Jalis have a multifunctional purpose as not only an artistic design but to also allow for the circulation of air, shelter from direct sunlight, as well as privacy.

                        <p>India is characterized by a collectivist culture, where a strong emphasis is placed on fostering communal ties. A notable example of this is the courtyard structure in a typical Indian home. Known by various regional names, these courtyards are consistently positioned at the center of the home and serve as vibrant living spaces where friends and family come together. This arrangement not only reflects cultural traditions but also holds functional significance. Beyond its cultural roots, the courtyard functions as a natural ventilation system for the entire home. The integration of cultural practices with practical considerations in architectural design underscores the rich tapestry of traditions in Indian homes.</p>

This approach acknowledges the intersectionality of environmental consciousness and community engagement in architectural design.</p>

                    <p class="text">Not acknowledging the impacts of colonialism can be detrimental. Understanding the historical context, motivations, and consequences of colonial practices is essential for becoming efficient designers. By delving into the hows and whys of colonial legacies, we can critically evaluate the root causes of various social, economic, and political issues. This awareness is crucial for assessing whether current practices are truly beneficial to the communities they aim to serve.</br></br>

                    Recognizing the importance of culture-specific design adds another layer to this understanding. Approaching problem-solving and development with sensitivity to diverse cultural contexts ensures that solutions are not only effective but also respectful of local traditions and values. This perspective encourages a more inclusive and equitable approach, fostering a deeper connection between the communities they impact. Acknowledging colonial histories and embracing culture-specific design empowers us to navigate complex issues with greater insight and empathy.</p>
