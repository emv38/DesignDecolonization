                <p>Design Decolonization takes into account the ties between historical desgin trends and Eurocentric/Anglocentric perspectives. Through this perspective, there is little consideration for marginalized groups and that is reflected in these practices. This is especially harmful, as it can lead to unsustainable design theory and can isolate groups that can otherwise benefit from culture-specific design. </br>
                Specifically, lets look at a country with years of colonialism in its history: India. </br>
                Understanding the effects of colonialism is the first step to becoming aware of the effects of eurocentric design practices on non-european countries.</p>
