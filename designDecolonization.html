                <p>Design Decolonization takes into account the ties between historical desgin trends and Eurocentric/Anglocentric perspectives. Through this perspective, there is little consideration for marginalized groups and that is reflected in these practices. This is especially harmful, as it can lead to unsustainable design theory and can isolate groups that can otherwise benefit from culture-specific design. </br>
                Specifically, lets look at a country with years of colonialism in its history: India. </br>
                Understanding the effects of colonialism is the first step to becoming aware of the effects of eurocentric design practices on non-european countries.</p>

                        <p>Continuity and patterns play a huge role in many traditional indian designs. An example of this can be found in Jali's, or pierced screens. Jali's consist of geometric patterns usually of a hexagonal and octagonal pattern. In addition, they can also be adorned with flowers, trees, or a paisley decoration, for more complexity. Jalis have a multifunctional purpose as not only an artistic design but to also allow for the circulation of air, shelter from direct sunlight, as well as privacy.

                <h1>So, why is this important?</h1>
                <p>Not acknowledging the impacts of colonialism can be detrimental. Understanding the historical context, motivations, and consequences of colonial practices is essential for becoming efficient designers. By delving into the hows and whys of colonial legacies, we can critically evaluate the root causes of various social, economic, and political issues. This awareness is crucial for assessing whether current practices are truly beneficial to the communities they aim to serve.</br></br>

                Recognizing the importance of culture-specific design adds another layer to this understanding. Approaching problem-solving and development with sensitivity to diverse cultural contexts ensures that solutions are not only effective but also respectful of local traditions and values. This perspective encourages a more inclusive and equitable approach, fostering a deeper connection between the communities they impact. Acknowledging colonial histories and embracing culture-specific design empowers us to navigate complex issues with greater insight and empathy.</p>
